SCSS Boilerplate
================

A 'naked' boilerplate for quickly starting off your projects. The CSS is handled with a SMACSS structure for maintainability.

## Features

* Uses 'normalize.css' by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas)
* SMACSS folder layout
* Added module abstracts
* Px to em and px to rem mixin
* Keyframe animation mixin (temp)

## Todo

* Rename container.scss to something else
