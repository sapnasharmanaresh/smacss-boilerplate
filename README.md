SCSS Boilerplate
================

A 'naked' boilerplate for quickly starting off your projects. The CSS is handled with a SMACSS structure for maintainability.

## Features

* Uses 'normalize.css' by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas)
* Uses Zepto instead of jQuery
* SMACSS folder layout
* Added module abstracts
* Px to em and px to rem mixin
* Media object by [Nicole Sullivan](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/)
* Flag object by [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/2013/05/the-flag-object/)

## Any thoughts?

I hope not!
